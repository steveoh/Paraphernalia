- [A/C Compressor Disconnect with defrost setting](https://www.tacomaworld.com/threads/a-c-on-with-defrost.7160/)

So I got bored and wanted to disable the A/C from coming on when selected the mixed(floor/windshield) and windshield only modes on the environmental selector. It kind of sucks to have the heat on in the middle of the winter only to have the A/C turn on and waste MPH. 
So consider this is an Eco-Friendly mod!:D
After looking at the schematics I found that the green wire from the D3 connector triggered the A/C amplifier to engage the compressor. There is also a separate trigger wire for the manual A/C switch. Bonus!
Here is how it's done:

Locate the D3 connector on the defroster servo and remove it.

Remove the white retainer and insert a small piece of wire to release the SOLID Green #3 wire. Not the Green with Black stripe.

Fold it back for safe keeping and tape it up to prevent shorting.

Then plug it back into the Servo. Don't forget to re-install the white retainer!!

I've tested this for a few days and the A/C will still turn on with the manual A/C button on the environmental control panel.

Edit:
There were some questions on how to remove the terminal from the plug (plastic) and I just wanted to clarify for those who have yet to take one part.
After you remove the white retainer, you still need to insert the helper wire, into the inverted 'T' slot below the square slot, to remove the spring loaded clip still holding the terminal to the plug.

Edit:
Fellow TW member rlg0613 suggested a jewelers screwdriver which I didn't even think of.

Edit:
I added a diagram to clarify this.

- [Disable Seatbelt Warning Chime](https://www.tacomaworld.com/threads/seat-belt-beeper-light-disable-alternative-diy.320984/#post-8382780)

Turn the Car 'ON', but do not start the engine (Leave your foot off the brake). Cycle your trip reset knob until it reads ODO. Turn the ignition back off. Wait a couple of seconds.
Make sure seat belt is not fastened
Turn the ignition back on, do not start the car (Leave you foot off the break) As soon as you see everything light up, press and hold the trip reset knob and do a long 12 second count.
Keep your finger on the trip reset knob. Fasten your seat belt, as soon as you fasten your seat belt, you should see the ODO display go from XXXX miles to "b-on". At that time take your finger off the trip reset knob and press it again. It should cycle to "b-off". You should be all set and turn the ignition off and unfasten your seat belt.)
